# SQL-Data-Access

This project follows the purchased coursework of Tim Corey @ https://www.iamtimcorey.com/p/sql-databases-from-start-to-finish

Here are the project goals:
1) Create a simple database populated with dummy data from https://www.mockaroo.com/
2) Build an application that connects to a SQL database server to retrieve the dummy data.
3) Enhance the application to allow us to add our own data to the database.
4) Search using our application for data that has been added to verify the merger of data.
